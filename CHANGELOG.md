All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

<!--
Recommendation: for ease of reading, use the following order:
- Added
- Changed
- Fixed
-->
## [3.3.2-beallio.1] - 2026-09-27

### Changed
- Synced with upstream PlayTime 3.3.1, including updated Decky UI and other dependencies. The remix's settings and in-place plugin identity remain unchanged.

## [3.3.1-beallio.13] - 2026-08-09

### Changed
- Game Management now shows each section's explanation inside the same box as its button, instead of in a separate block underneath.
- The GitHub and changelog links point at the remix repository, and the changelog opens the release notes for the version you are running.
- Game Associations lists are sorted by game name — both the existing groups (and the games within each group) and the list of games you can pick when creating an association. Games sharing a name keep a stable order.
- The Annual Replay page no longer ends with a footer.

## [3.3.1-beallio.12] - 2026-08-08

### Fixed
- Non-Steam games launched through the Heroic Games Launcher now show as available on the Deck instead of "Status unavailable". Steam Deck's browser parses `heroic://launch` URIs differently from the environment the tests run in, which made every Heroic shortcut fail classification on device.
- Non-Steam games launched directly through a Proton prefix — shortcuts whose launch options are environment assignments followed by `%command%` — now resolve instead of reporting "Status unavailable".
- Steam games you own but have not installed no longer report as "Installed". Install state now comes from Steam's local games collection rather than from a field that only says the game runs on this platform.

## [3.3.1-beallio.11] - 2026-08-08

### Changed
- Migrated remix releases to a Decky-updatable prerelease version scheme. Decky can now offer remix updates because the scheme moves the remix counter into SemVer prerelease precedence and forbids ignored build metadata.

## [3.3.0] - 2026-07-16

### Changed
- Settings storage now uses versioning and migration support, making future settings updates safer and preserving existing preferences.
- General settings updates are saved more reliably when multiple options are changed in quick succession.
- Updated internal dependencies and development tooling.

### Fixed
- Native Steam overview information is now preserved for games without PlayTime data. Thanks @beallio
- Improved handling of settings defaults and invalid stored values.
- Improved SQLite connection error handling and game statistics session handling.
- Improved non-Steam game filtering performance.

## [3.2.5] - 2026-03-27

### Added
- **First day of the week** — you can now choose whether your week starts on Sunday or Monday in **Settings > General**.
- **Sunday highlighting** — Sundays are now displayed in red across calendar and report views, making weekends easier to spot.

### Changed
- Upgraded internal dependencies to keep everything up to date and secure.

### Fixed
- Fixed occasional silent failures when loading data, improving overall stability.
- Weekly and monthly reports now properly refresh when the selected date range changes.
- Various typo corrections across the app for a cleaner experience.

## [3.2.4] - 2026-03-09

### Added
- Ko-Fi QR code for easy support: now you can quickly access the plugin's Ko-Fi page by scanning the QR code in the Quick Access Menu or Settings. A simple way to show your appreciation and help fund future updates!
- In **Settings > About** was added nicknames of users who supported me on Ko-Fi!

### Fixed
- Fixed various bugs across the plugin for improved stability and performance.

## [3.2.3] - 2026-03-09

### Changed
- Upgraded internal dependencies to keep everything up to date and secure.

## [3.2.2] - 2026-02-18

### Added
- Game associations: link two games together so their playtime is combined into one entry in statistics. Useful when the same game is installed as both a Steam game and a Non-Steam shortcut, or when a game was re-added under a different name.
  - **Create associations** — pick a "parent" game and a "child" game; the child's playtime merges into the parent in all reports.
  - **Remove associations** — unlink games at any time; their playtime goes back to being counted separately.
  - Association management is available in **Settings > Game Management**.
- Tracking statuses are now visible in reports and the game options menu — see at a glance which games are paused, hidden, or ignored.

### Changed
- "Tracking" section in Settings renamed to **"Game Management"**.

### Fixed
- Time interval calculations for more accurate playtime tracking.
- Date formatting in reports.

## [3.2.1] - 2026-01-02

### Added
- Game Tracking Statuses: control how each game is tracked and displayed in statistics via **Settings > Game Management**.

  | Status | Visible in Stats? | Tracks New Sessions? |
  |---|---|---|
  | **Default** | Yes | Yes |
  | **Pause** | Yes | No — useful for games you're taking a break from |
  | **Hidden** | No — removed from all charts and reports | Yes — still records time in the background |
  | **Ignore** | No | No — completely excluded |

  - Full management UI to browse, search, and change statuses for all your games.

### Fixed
- 64-bit Steam IDs are now correctly detected, preventing data loading problems.

## [3.2.0] - 2025-12-19

### Added
- Multi-user support: PlayTime now keeps separate playtime data for each Steam user on the device. If multiple people share the same Steam Deck, each person's statistics are fully isolated.
  - Each user automatically gets their own database the first time they log in.
  - Existing playtime data is **automatically migrated** to the user profile — no manual steps needed.
  - The legacy database is preserved as a backup and is never modified.

> [!NOTE]
> If you share your Steam Deck with family or friends, everyone now has their own independent playtime history!

## [3.1.4] - 2025-12-20

### Fixed
- Fixed a bug where the plugin **would not start on a brand-new device** (or a freshly reset one) due to a settings initialization issue.

## [3.1.3] - 2025-12-16

### Changed
- Upgraded internal dependencies. No user-facing changes.

## [3.1.2] - 2025-12-10

### Added
- Year Retrospective (Replay) now supports **browsing multiple years**, starting from 2025.
- A **changelog button** now appears in Settings whenever the plugin is updated, so you can easily see what changed.

### Changed
- Achievement messages in the Year Retrospective are now more **personalized and fun**.
- Replay streak calculation is more accurate — only counts unique days you played.
- Settings descriptions for chart options are clearer.
- Minor UI cleanup.

### Fixed
- Replay now shows the correct year based on the actual date.

## [3.1.1] - 2025-12-03

### Added

The `Monthly View` statistics are now more detailed. See how much time you played each day for specific games.
Bar colors are generated based on game covers, with dominant colors calculated by [vibrant.dev](https://vibrant.dev/).

To enable this feature, set `Stacked bars per game` to `Yes` in `Settings > General > Charts`.
